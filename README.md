## Dataset:
  <samp>This dataset “electric.vehicle.data.csv” contains information about the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing. BEV is an all-electric vehicle using one or more batteries to store the electrical energy that powers the motor, which is charged by plugging the vehicle into an electric power source. On the other hand, a PHEV is a vehicle that uses one or more batteries to power an electric motor; uses another fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, to power an internal combustion engine or other propulsion sources; and is charged by plugging the vehicle into an electric power source. The electric range of an electric vehicle is the number of miles it can travel on a fully charged battery.</samp>
